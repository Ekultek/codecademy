Description:

This XOR That?

The XOR (^) or exclusive or operator compares two numbers on a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that
number are turned on if either of the corresponding bits of the two numbers are 1, but not both.

    a:  00101010   42
    b:  00001111   15
================
a ^ b:  00100101   37

Keep in mind that if a bit is off in both numbers, it stays off in the result. Note that XOR-ing a number with itself
will always result in 0.

So remember, for every given bit in a and b:

0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0

Therefore:

 111 (7) ^ 1010 (10) = 1101 (13)

Challenge:
For practice, print the result of using ^ on 0b1110 and 0b101 as a binary string. Try to do it on your own
without using the ^ operator.
