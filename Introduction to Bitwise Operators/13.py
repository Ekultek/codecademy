Description:

Just Flip Out

Using the XOR (^) operator is very useful for flipping bits. Using ^ on a bit with the number one will return a result
where that bit is flipped.

For example, let's say I want to flip all of the bits in a. I might do this:

a = 0b110 # 6
mask = 0b111 # 7
desired =  a ^ mask # 0b1

Challenge:
In the editor is the 8 bit variable a. Use a bitmask and the value a in order to achieve a result where all of the
bits in a are flipped. Be sure to print your answer as a bin() string!

a = 0b11101110
b = 0b11111111

print bin(a ^ b)
