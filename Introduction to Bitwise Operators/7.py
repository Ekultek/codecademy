Description:

A BIT of This AND That

The bitwise AND (&) operator compares two numbers on a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that number
are turned on if the corresponding bits of both numbers are 1. For example:

     a:   00101010   42
     b:   00001111   15
===================
 a & b:   00001010   10

As you can see, the 2's bit and the 8's bit are the only bits that are on in both a and b, so a & b only contains those
bits. Note that using the & operator can only result in a number that is less than or equal to the smaller of the
two values.

So remember, for every given bit in a and b:

0 & 0 = 0
0 & 1 = 0
1 & 0 = 0
1 & 1 = 1

Therefore,

 0b111 (7) & 0b1010 (10) = 0b10

which equals two.

Challenge:


print out the result of calling bin() on 0b1110 & 0b101.

See if you can guess what the output will be!
