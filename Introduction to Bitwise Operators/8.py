Description:

A BIT of This OR That

The bitwise OR (|) operator compares two numbers on a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that number
are turned on if either of the corresponding bits of either number are 1. For example:

    a:  00101010  42
    b:  00001111  15
================
a | b:  00101111  47

Note that the bitwise | operator can only create results that are greater than or equal to the larger of the two
integer inputs.

So remember, for every given bit in a and b:

0 | 0 = 0
0 | 1 = 1
1 | 0 = 1
1 | 1 = 1

Meaning

 110 (6) | 1010 (10) = 1110 (14)

Challenge:
For practice, print out the result of using | on 0b1110 and 0b101 as a binary string. Try to do it on your own without
using the | operator if you can help it.
