Description:

The open() Function

Let's walk through the process of writing to a file one step at a time.

The first code that you saw executed in the previous exercise was this:

f = open("output.txt", "w")

This told Python to open output.txt in "w" mode ("w" stands for "write"). We stored the result of this operation in a
file object, f.

Doing this opens the file in write-mode and prepares Python to send data into the file.

Challenge:
Create a variable, my_file, and set it equal to calling the open() function on output.txt. In this case, pass "r+" as
a second argument to the function so the file will allow you to read and write to it! (See the Hint for details.)
"""
my_file = open("output.txt", "r+")
