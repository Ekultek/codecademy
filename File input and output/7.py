Description:

The 'with' and 'as' Keywords

Programming is all about getting the computer to do the work. Is there a way to get Python to automatically
close our files for us?

Of course there is. This is Python.

You may not know this, but file objects contain a special pair of built-in methods: __enter__() and __exit__().
The details aren't important, but what is important is that when a file object's __exit__() method is invoked,
it automatically closes the file. How do we invoke this method? With with and as.

The syntax looks like this:

with open("file", "mode") as variable:
    # Read or write to the file

Challenge:
Check out the example in the editor. Note that we don't explicitly close() our file, and remember that if we don't
close a file, our data will get stuck in the buffer. Click Save & Submit Code and check out text.txt to see the results.
"""
with open("text.txt", "w") as textfile:
	textfile.write("Success!")
