PSA: Buffering Data

We keep telling you that you always need to close your files after you're done writing to them. Here's why!

During the I/O process, data is buffered: this means that it is held in a temporary location before being written to the
file.

Python doesn't flush the buffer—that is, write data to the file—until it's sure you're done writing. One way to
do this is to close the file. If you write to a file without closing, the data won't make it to the target file.

Challenge:


Check out our extremely bad code in the editor. Click Save & Submit Code—you'll note that our read_file.read() didn't
read any data back! (The text still appears in text.txt, though, because we closed the file behind the scenes for you.
Safety first!)

    1.Add a write_file.close() call on line 9.
    2.Add a read_file.close() on line 13.
    3.Run the code again.
    4.This time, you'll see the data come through!

# Write to the file
write_file.write("Not closing files is VERY BAD.")

write_file.close()

# Try to read from the file
print read_file.read()
