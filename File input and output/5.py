Description:

Reading Between the Lines

What if we want to read from a file line by line, rather than pulling the entire file in at once. Thankfully,
Python includes a readline() function that does exactly that.

If you open a file and call .readline() on the file object, you'll get the first line of the file; subsequent calls
to .readline() will return successive lines.

Challenge:

    1.Declare a new variable my_file and store the result of calling open() on the "text.txt" file in "r"ead-only mode.
    2.On three separate lines, print out the result of calling my_file.readline(). See how it gets the next line each time?
    3.Don't forget to close() your file when you're done with it!)

my_file = open("text.txt", "r")
print my_file.readline()
print my_file.readline()
print my_file.readline()
my_file.close()
