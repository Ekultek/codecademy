Warning: Here Be Dragons

Inheritance is a tricky concept, so let's go through it step by step.

Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another, and it's used to express
an is-a relationship. For example, a Panda is a bear, so a Panda class could inherit from a Bear class.
However, a Toyota is not a Tractor, so it shouldn't inherit from the Tractor class (even if they have a lot of
attributes and methods in common). Instead, both Toyota and Tractor could ultimately inherit from the same
Vehicle class.

Challenge:
Check out the code in the editor. We've defined a class, Customer, as well as a ReturningCustomer class that inherits
from Customer. Note that we don't define the display_cart method in the body of ReturningCustomer, but it will still
have access to that method via inheritance. Click Save & Submit Code to see for yourself!
