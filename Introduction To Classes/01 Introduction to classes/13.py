Description:

Override!

Sometimes you'll want one class that inherits from another to not only take on the methods and attributes of its parent,
 but to override one or more of them.

class Employee(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def greet(self, other):
        print "Hello, %s" % other.name

class CEO(Employee):
    def greet(self, other):
        print "Get back to work, %s!" % other.name

ceo = CEO("Emily")
emp = Employee("Steve")
emp.greet(ceo)
# Hello, Emily
ceo.greet(emp)
# Get back to work, Steve!

Rather than have a separate greet_underling method for our CEO, we override (or re-create) the greet method on top of
the base Employee.greet method. This way, we don't need to know what type of Employee we have before we greet another
Employee.

Challenge:

    1.Create a new class, PartTimeEmployee, that inherits from Employee.
    2.Give your derived class a calculate_wage method that overrides Employee's. It should take self and hours as arguments.
    3.Because PartTimeEmployee.calculate_wage overrides Employee.calculate_wage, it still needs to set self.hours = hours.
    4.It should return the part-time employee's number of hours worked multiplied by 12.00 (that is, they get $12.00
      per hour instead of $20.00).

    def __init__(self, employee_name):
        self.employee_name = employee_name

    def calculate_wage(self, hours):
        self.hours = hours
        return hours * 20.00

    def calculate_wage(self, hours):
        self.hours = hours
        return hours * 12.00
