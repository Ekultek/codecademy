Description:

This Looks Like a Job For...

On the flip side, sometimes you'll be working with a derived class (or subclass) and realize that you've overwritten a
method or attribute defined in that class' base class (also called a parent or superclass) that you actually need.
Have no fear! You can directly access the attributes or methods of a superclass with Python's built-in super call.

The syntax looks like this:

class Derived(Base):
   def m(self):
       return super(Derived, self).m()

Where m() is a method from the base class.

Challenge:
First, inside your PartTimeEmployee class:

    1.Add a new method called full_time_wage with the arguments self and hours.
    2.That method should return the result of a super call to the calculate_wage method of PartTimeEmployee's parent class.
      Use the example above for help.

Then, after your class:

    1.Create an instance of the PartTimeEmployee class called milton. Don't forget to give it a name.
    2.Finally, print out the result of calling his full_time_wage method. You should see his wage printed out at $20.00
      per hour! (That is, for 10 hours, the result should be 200.00.)

"""
class Employee(object):
    """Models real-life employees!"""

    def __init__(self, employee_name):
        self.employee_name = employee_name

    def calculate_wage(self, hours):
        self.hours = hours
        return hours * 20.00


# Add your code below!
class PartTimeEmployee(Employee):
    def calculate_wage(self, hours):
        self.hours = hours
        return hours * 12.00

    def full_time_wage(self, hours):
        return super(PartTimeEmployee, self).calculate_wage(hours)


milton = PartTimeEmployee(Employee)
print milton.full_time_wage(10)
