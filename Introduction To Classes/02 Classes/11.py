Description:

Building useful classes

Chances are, you won't be designing Car classes in the real world anytime soon. Usually, classes are most useful for
holding and accessing abstract collections of data.

One useful class method to override is the built-in __repr__() method, which is short for representation; by providing
a return value in this method, we can tell Python how to represent an object of our class (for instance, when using
a print statement).

Challenge:

    1.Define a Point3D class that inherits from object
    2.Inside the Point3D class, define an __init__() function that accepts self, x, y, and z, and assigns these numbers
      to the member variables self.x, self.y, self.z
    3.Define a __repr__() method that returns "(%d, %d, %d)" % (self.x, self.y, self.z). This tells Python to represent
      this object in the following format: (x, y, z).
    4.Outside the class definition, create a variable named my_point containing a new instance of Point3D with x=1, y=2,
      and z=3.
    5.Finally, print my_point.

class Point3D(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

    def __repr__(self):
        return "(%d, %d, %d)" % (self.x, self.y, self.z)


my_point = Point3D(1, 2, 3)
print my_point
