Description:

Create an instance of a class

We can use classes to create new objects, which we say are instances of those classes.

Creating a new instance of a class is as easy as saying:

newObject = ClassName()

Challenge:
Below your Car class, create a new object named my_car that is an instance of Car.

class Car(object):
    pass

my_car = Car()
